    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this milestone is to do some Graph Signal Processing (GSP) on the data of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note about plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several questions in this milestone that ask you to plot a signal on your network.\n",
    "There are several ways from which you could approach it.\n",
    "In all cases, compute the position of the nodes a single time at the beginning, as this is likely to be a costly operation.\n",
    "Using a single layout for all the graph plots will also make it easier to compare the plots.\n",
    "Indeed, the only thing changing between plots is the signal displayed.\n",
    "You can represent the features/labels lying on the graph via node **colors**.\n",
    "To do so, make sure to have a consistent color map throughout and remember to display a colorbar and scale in all plots, so that we can tell what numbers the colors represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An option is to use the **Laplacian eigenmaps** that you have seen in the previous milestone to embed your graph on the plane. For example:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n",
    "  plt.scatter(eigenvectors[:, 1], eigenvectors[:, 2], c=signal, alpha=0.5)\n",
    "  plt.colorbar()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Another option is to use the plotting capabilities of **[NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io)**.\n",
    "  See the documentation of its [drawing methods](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/drawing.html).\n",
    "  For example:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  import networkx as nx\n",
    "  graph = nx.from_scipy_sparse_matrix(adjacency)\n",
    "  coords = nx.spring_layout(graph)  # Force-directed layout.\n",
    "  coords = eigenvectors[:, 1:3]  # Laplacian eigenmaps.\n",
    "  nx.draw_networkx_nodes(graph, coords, node_size=60, node_color=signal)\n",
    "  nx.draw_networkx_edges(graph, coords, alpha=0.3)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Another option is to use the plotting capabilities of the **[PyGSP](https://github.com/epfl-lts2/pygsp)**, a Python package for Graph Signal Processing.\n",
    "  **Note that your are forbidden to use the PyGSP for anything else than plotting.**\n",
    "  See the documentation of its [plotting utilities](https://pygsp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/plotting.html).\n",
    "  For example:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  import pygsp as pg\n",
    "  graph = pg.graphs.Graph(adjacency)\n",
    "  graph.set_coordinates('spring')  # Force-directed layout.\n",
    "  graph.set_coordinates(eigenvectors[:, 1:3])  # Laplacian eigenmaps.\n",
    "  graph.plot_signal(signal)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "* Yet another option is to save your graph on disk, use **[Gephi](https://gephi.org)** externally, to visualize the graph, save the graph with the Gephi coordinates and finally load the nodes coordinates back into the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage you to try all the above methods before making your choice. Then be consistent and use only one throughout the milestone.\n",
    "NetworkX and PyGSP should already be installed in your environement. If that's not the case, install with `conda install networkx pygsp` (after activating the `ntds_2018` environment)."

    "When picking a threshold of 0, the 2-Norm yields very good results up to very small ratios. If we choose different thresholds, the results quickly degrade. This is because the 2-Norm tends to produce estimates between the smallest and largest inputs -1 and 1, which makes chosing a good threshold important. As we have two balanced clusters, choosing the threshold to be zero is the most reasonable choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 1-Norm, results are almost entirely independent of the threshold we choose. Indeed, the estimated values tend to be bellow or above the smallest and largest inputs -1 and 1, making the choice of a threshold between -1 and 1 futile. Performance is only slightly worse than using the 2-Norm with a carefully selected threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is an easy and justified way to pick a good threshold, taking the 2-Norm might produce better results. If this is not the case, one can get good results across the board with the 1-Norm using an almost arbitrary threshold."
